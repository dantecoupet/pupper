dogs dogs and more dogs

This project was created last year. I had discussed this with my peers but we ended up not taking it on. I want to take
on this project solo (as it was my idea), and see what happens.

I have no experience or credentials but this whole idea is sound.

This will be an app for ios/android.

Target audience: dog owners
The service will access your location and show you other users nearby. I have many ideas as to how the interface will
be handled, but for right now, I would like it to be just a swipe and messaging system. Details will come later...
