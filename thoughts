need to have a notice that says we are not responsible for any problems the users encounter. will need legal assistance for this.

when users decide to link, pupper will ask if they want to enter contact info of someone they know to act as an emergency contact. pupper will notify that
contact where the user will be going and who they will be meeting with.

before users meet, pupper will always give a notice that the user is responsible for safety and should stay aware. pupper will give warnings about 
avoiding meeting at night, avoid meeting in secluded areas, and emphasize meeting in a public place.

i think it would be a good idea for pupper to have a map showing locations of people who are already on a date? 

should user be able to choose gender of the owner? like tinder? could be good or bad. i would like for women to feel free to only hang out with other women if
they are uncomfortable with men, but also i think i can just leave it open to any gender. you can just swipe left on any men

pupper should allow group dates

types of pupper users:
adoption companies / people looking for a pupper / people looking for a playdate / reputable breeders?

Selling points:
people need to socialize their dogs

finding a dog is kinda tuff, you need to search a bunch of sites but it would be great if everything was on one app and it would be a lot more personalized with
specific details and even small clips of the dog you want to adopt
